                Sharing a bit of my journey in the tech world! ðŸ’»ðŸš€ In 2018, while attending high school and a technical IT course, I immersed myself in the vast world of web development. Although the course covered various languages, it was at the intersection of HTML, CSS, JS, Tailwind, and React that I found my true passion.

                Since then, I've dedicated countless hours to mastering these technologies, always seeking to improve my skills. Being a junior frontend developer allows me to explore creativity and logic when creating attractive and functional interfaces. Each project is a learning opportunity, where I can apply my knowledge to overcome challenges and provide efficient solutions.
